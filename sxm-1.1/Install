To build and install SXM:

1.  `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.
Here you can either follow the steps as written below or type
`make all' to do 2-4 in one step.

2.  Type `make' to compile the engine. If you want to change
`make' variables like CFLAGS, edit the Makefile first.

3.  Type `make image' to build the heap image file (sxi).

4. Type `make Formlist' to collect a list of top-level forms
(this list is for reference only; it is not installed anywhere).

5.  If you want to run self-tests, type `make test'.

6.  Type `make install' to install the programs and man pages.
By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin'.  You can specify an installation prefix
other than `/usr/local' by overriding the default prefix like
this:
 
 make all prefix=~joe/bin
 make install prefix=~joe/bin

7.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To remove all the files
created by the building process type `make realclean'.
