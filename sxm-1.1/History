December 9, 2001 (release candidate for v1.1)

Fixes for bugs found during parallel FXM development:
- wrong mode in popen call
- sxae_type now handles NT_BOOLEAN
- string-match? now correctly matches "foo" with "foo*"
- get-output-string: gc error fixed (port is protected)
- gc error in sxIntern: Scheme string in mksym (fixed)
- restore-image bug: vmsp = 0 on restore (fixed)

September 26, 2001

Two minor fixes: testmutable(lst) in reverse! and correct error
reporting in xlgaoport() 

August 18, 2001

Added support for SRFI-9: Defining Record Types.

August 16, 2001

Added built-in POSITION/POSV/POSQ and Chez-like record facilities
(sans fancy field specifiers and custom printers). Fixed bug in 
HAS-TABLE-REMOVE! (EQ? was used as test in all cases).

April 19, 2001

Character comparison predicates take one or more args now (were
binary only). This is useful to check character ranges as in
(char<=? #\a c #\z)

April 8, 2001

Extended syntax for characters (#\cXXXXX and "...\cXXXXXX;...",
X stands for hex digit, 1 or more digits make up the character code).
In SXM, this syntax coexists with C-like string escapes like \n \r ... 

April 5, 2001

Console port (Win2K) now returns eof on ^Z (as expected).
Unicode console port (Win2K) now returns LF only, not CR,LF.
Win2K console bug: pasted multiline text not ending in CR,LF
is not processed correctly (workaround: always cut full lines)

February 20, 2001

1) Added %at primitive to access SOBJs at numerical addresses, i.e.
if you get "Error in #<Code @a097468>: too few arguments.", try
(disassemble (%at #xa097468))

January 19, 2001

1) Fixed optimizer bug (incorrect handling of ac/stack-lambda with 
#!rest args). Now FROBIT marks such lambda forms as stack-lambda.

2) Cast in osunix.c for C++ compilers (signal handlers)
